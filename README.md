# Access Code 2.1 Final Project Proposal

**Project Name: TBD Goal Setting**  
**Team Name: Goal Setting**  
**Team Members: Eric Sze, Ayuna Vogel, Charlres Kang**  

## The Problem 

Not being on time



Hardware experimentation, in particular, has a high barrier to entry. Popular existing hardware products:

* [Little Bits] (http://littlebits.cc) (starter kits $99-199). 
* [Lego Mindstorms] (http://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms) robotics kit ($349.99).
* [Boe-Bot] (https://www.parallax.com/product/boe-bot-robot) - robot kit commonly used in schools ($159.99).

We envision our primary users to be kids as young as 5 and as old as teens (realizing that we'll need a UI/UX that can appeal to this full age range). Our app would be engaging to a child while also being able to interest adults in helper roles (parents, teachers). Users would range from a child learning independently, parent(s) with a child, or a teacher with a classroom full of students.

## The Solution 

Enable users to make commitment contracts to reach their personal goals

#### Baseline features



The app:


#### Bonus features

* Simple web platform for sharing robot patterns + programs (Google Blockly enables this via [cloud storage](https://developers.google.com/blockly/installation/cloud-storage)).
* Robot add-ons: lights, sensors, internet connectivity.
* Translation to other spoken languages (e.g. Spanish).
